# hello-world
short description:
I love to swim, hike, hang out with friends, and play video games.
I'm an absolute sucker for animals- my family has 5 cats, a dog, two hamsters, and a bearded dragon at home!
I have little experience with coding languages (besides a half-year class on Java) but I'm a quick learner and I have a particular passion to learn coding!
